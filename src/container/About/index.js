									There are thousands of different cosmetic products on the

									According to Zero Waste Week, more than 120 billion units of

									As public interest in sustainability continues to climb, many

									extend beyond trends — increasing studies show the toxicity of

								<p className="pt-4">
									Traceability is the process of tracing the origins, movement,
									and evolution of products and materials.
								</p>
								<p>
									Traceability means being able to see what is in a product, and
									where all the ingredients come from, including how they are
									extracted, harvested, or otherwise produced. Ideally, we would
									also be able to tell how these raw ingredients are processed
									and transported, along every step of the supply chain until
									they reach you, the consumer.
								</p>
								<p>
									The point of traceability is to ensure that what we are told
									is in a product actually is in the product, and that
									responsible sourcing standards are being followed throughout
									the manufacturing process. Simply put, without ingredient
									traceability there is no sustainability.
									<b className="section-subtitle">
										{' '}
										Traceability allows consumers to ask:
									</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Where is a product manufactured, and by whom?</li>
										<li>
											What exactly is in this particular batch of a product?
										</li>
										<li>Where do those ingredients come from?</li>
										<li>
											How does the sourcing of these ingredients affect workers,
											local communities, and the environment?
										</li>
										<li>
											Are the ingredients and processes third-party verified in
											any way?
										</li>
									</ul>
